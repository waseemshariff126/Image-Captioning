# Image-Captioning
In this project, you will create a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.
Project Overview
In this project, you will create a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.

After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train your network, you will test your network on novel images!

Project Instructions
The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order:

0_Dataset.ipynb
1_Preliminaries.ipynb
2_Training.ipynb
3_Inference.ipynb

**You MUST enable GPU mode for this project**
